# APEX-55 | Universal Autonomous Racing & Competition Intelligence Platform

**Project Codename:** APEX-55
**Software Brain:** Davion
**Founder:** Newton Manyeki Kamau

> A living documentation and archive for a universal autonomous vehicle designed to win hackathons, competitions, and eventually aim for Guinness World Records.

---

## 1. Project Overview
**APEX-55** is a standardized-hardware autonomous vehicle designed to showcase the capabilities of **Davion**, a modular real-time decision-making software stack.

Key points:
- Hardware is intentionally constrained.
- Intelligence, adaptability, and software architecture are the core innovations.
- The same system is used across multiple competitive domains (racing, football robots, sumo, simulations, hackathons).

**Mission Statement:**
To create a universal, reproducible, and high-performance autonomous system capable of adapting to any competitive environment.

## 2. The Meaning of “55”
The number **55** represents purpose, discipline, and legacy.
It serves as a reminder of dedication and continuity, encoded into the identity of APEX-55.

## 3. System Architecture

### Hardware Layer
- Chassis and F1-inspired mechanical design
- Motors, drivetrain, steering, braking
- Sensors: camera, IMU, encoders, LiDAR (if used)
- Compute unit and power system

### Software Layer (Davion)
- Perception abstraction
- Localization and state estimation
- Decision and planning engine
- Control and actuation
- Rule and objective engine (for switching competitions)

> Note: The same codebase adapts to different challenges by changing rules and objectives rather than rewriting logic.

## 4. Development Timeline
Chronological milestones including:
- Concept design
- Mechanical build
- Electronics integration
- Software iterations
- Simulation testing
- Real-world testing

Each milestone must include:
- Date
- Tools used
- Problems faced
- Solutions implemented

---

## 5. Tools, Technologies, and Stack
List all tools used and explain choice:
- Programming languages
- Frameworks and libraries
- Simulation tools
- Hardware components
- CAD and design software
- Version control and documentation tools

---

## 6. Hackathon & Competition Log
For each event, document:
- Competition name
- Location and date
- Challenge type (racing, football, sumo, simulation, etc.)
- Rules and constraints
- Role of Davion
- Final result (rank, score, win)
- Photos, videos, timing data, judge feedback, certificates

---

## 7. Performance Evidence
Provide measurable data:
- Lap times
- Accuracy metrics
- Reaction times
- Stability under load
- Comparison charts against baseline systems

All metrics must be reproducible and clearly sourced.

---

## 8. Guinness World Record Preparation
Dedicated section for world-record attempts:
- Exact record category targeted
- Rules and criteria
- Repeatability methodology
- Logging and verification process
- Independent witnesses
- Raw data access

Ensure it reads like a **scientific audit trail**.

---

## 9. Open Research & Future Work
Outline:
- Planned upgrades
- Research questions
- Scalability to industry and education
- Future competitions

---

## 10. Media & Public Record
Centralize:
- Press mentions
- Talks
- Demos
- Videos
- Social documentation

---

## 11. Credits & Authorship
- Founder and Lead Engineer: **Newton Manyeki Kamau**
- Software Platform: **Davion**
- Project Codename: **APEX-55**

> Emphasize independent development and authorship.

---

## Design Requirements
- Minimalist, light theme
- Technical, not flashy
- Timestamped updates
- Downloadable PDFs for audits
- Permanent URLs for evidence

The site should feel like a **research lab notebook merged with a racing garage**.
